## 🏃‍♂️ Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure you have the following:

- **☕ Java 11+**: The application is built with **Spring Boot** and requires Java 11 or higher.
- **🔧 Maven**: Use Maven to build and manage project dependencies.
- **💳 Stripe Account**: You’ll need a **Stripe account** to get the **API keys** for payment processing.
- **🐬 MySQL Server**: To store product details and guest order information, you’ll need a **MySQL server**.

## 📋 Important Notes

- **Guest Checkout**: The app does not support account creation. Users are treated as guest customers and their order information is stored in the database.

- **Not Meant for Scalability**: This application is designed as a simple demonstration of the payment flow and is not intended to be highly scalable or production-ready. It is a lightweight app to showcase basic eCommerce functionality with Stripe.
